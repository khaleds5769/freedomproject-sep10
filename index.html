    <p>Back then these techs were not so reliable because it was just invented and wasn't even innovated. </p>


    <h3> Technologies/equipments! </h3>
  
  <p> Today, we have so many technologies involving dentistry that help keep us safe. They are way more improved and more reliable with the advancements we have today. </p>

    <p> Some software apps that were created that also have an impact on us! </p>
    
   
    
 
  
    <h4> Software Apps:</h4>
  
  <ul>
  <li>MDLIVE (created for virtual meets with doctor) - MDLIVE is a very beneficial way of meeting with a doctor if you have any health problems especially during times like these where some of us canâ€™t go outside due to COVID. All you need to do is set up an appointment and a doctor would talk with you and prescribe to you any medications you may need. </li>
  
  <li>Dentalk- Dentalk is also such a beneficial app that has a huge impact on us. With Dentalk dentists are able to explain any conditions a patient may have with visual pictures as well as 3d pictures. This can help improve the understanding of the patient and help them understand the different treatments they may need. </li>
</ul>
  
  <p> Technology in dentistry is still evolving today to help improve and innovate it. Years from now, there will be more and more advanced technology that is invented in dentistry that will help us even more.</p>
  
 <h5> Some ideas that could be possibly be created in the future: </h5>
 
 <p> We, humans, are getting more and more creative with technology and with our ideas. We are getting more advanced and we are innovating new things that better our lives. The future is going to be nothing like today and will be way beyond creativity. Dentistry has had a huge improvement in its technology throughout the years. Here are some ideas that can maybe be invented/innovated in the future:</p>
 
 <ul> 
 <li> A robot that can learn and perform all the procedures and help fasten recovery. This robot will be very advanced and tested so many times before its first time. Every day new ideas can be brought up and innovated into what we have today to improve the technology in dentistry. </li>
 
 <li> A toothbrush that can help you identify how long you have been brushing for. Also, it can tell you the amount of pressure you are putting on your teeth. This can be beneficial and these innovations can be built on every day. </li>
 </ul>
